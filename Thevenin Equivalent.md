The Thevenin equivalent circuit is a [[Voltage Source]] with a [[Resistor]] in [[Series Circuits|series]].
Characterised by three related parameters: $v_{Th}$ $R_{Th}$ and $i_{sc}$

This circuit has the following properties:
Open circuit voltage: $$ v_{oc} = v_{Th}$$
Short circuit current:
$$ i_{sc} = \frac{v_{Th}}{R_{Th}}$$ 
##### Example:
Suppose you had a battery which you measured as 9V with no load, and 8.8V with a 120 $\ohm$ load. What is the Thevenin model of that battery
