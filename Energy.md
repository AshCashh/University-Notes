Energy is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognisable in the performance of [[Work]] and in the form of heat and light
- The unit of measurment for energy is joule (J)

Energy is the integral of power over time.
$$w(t) =\int_0^t p(t) \;dt$$
## Energy in a battery
- The battery of a phone is described as 3.85 V, 3000 mAh (milliamp hour)
- This means that the battery can supply 3.85 V at a current of 3 A for one hour.
- The energy in the battery is equal to p times time: 11.55 times 3600 = 41.58 kJ.
