#ee
The impedance $\mathbf{Z}$ of an [[Circuit Elements|Circuit Element]], measured in Ohms ($\ohm$), is its opposition to alternating current (AC). Impedance is represented as the sum of a real [[Resistance]] $R$ and imaginary reactance $X$.
$$\mathbf{Z}=R+j\mathbf{X}$$
Impedance $\mathbf{Z}$ is a complex number that captures the magnitude and phase change associated with a circuit element

## High Impedance
In [[Electronics]], high impedance means that a point in a [[Circuit]] allows a relatively small amount of [[Current]] through, per unit of applied [[Voltage]] at that point. High impedance circuits are low current and potentially high voltage, whereas low impedance circuits are the opposite. 

### Impedance of [[Resistor|Resistors]]

$$\mathbf{Z}=R, \phantom{A}\mathbf{Z}=R\angle0\degree$$

### Impedance of [[Inductor|Inductors]]
$$\mathbf{Z}=j\omega L,\phantom{A}\mathbf{Z}=\omega L\angle90\degree$$

### Impedance of [[Capacitor|Capacitors]]
$$\mathbf{Z}=\cfrac{1}{j\omega C},\phantom{A}\mathbf{Z}=\cfrac{1}{\omega C}\angle-90\degree$$

## Impedance in Series and Parallel
Impedances behave similarly to [[Resistor#Resistors in Series|resistors in series]] and [[Resistor#Resistors in Parallel|resistors in parallel]]

## Impedances are Complex
If we connect a resistor to an inductor or capacitor, the combined impedance is a complex number
