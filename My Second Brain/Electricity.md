Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter that has a property of electric [[Charge]]. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. Various common phenomena are related to electricity, including lighting, static electricity, electric heating, electric discharges and many others.

The presence of either a positive or negative electric charge produces an electric field. The movement of electric charges is an electric [[Current]] and produces a magnetic field. In most applications, a force acts on a charge with a magnitude given by Coulomb's law.
