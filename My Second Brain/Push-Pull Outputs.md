A push-pull digital output is the most common form of output used in [[Digital Outputs]]. It is commonly formed using two [[Transistors]] which act like [[Switches]]. The output driver A *drives* the output state *Y* to:
- HIGH by connecting the output net to the supply voltage +V
- LOW by connecting the output net to the ground voltage GND (0V)

Hence the output state *Y* is determined by the logic level of the output driver *A*. $Y=A$

The push-pull output *Y* can both source and sink [[Current]] from the connected net.
