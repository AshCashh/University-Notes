A sorting algorithm is an [[Algorithm]] that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order (alphabetical order) and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimising the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often used for canonicalising data and for producing human-readable output.

Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
1. The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element)
2. The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input

For optimum efficiency, the input data should be stored in a [[Linear Data Structures|Data Structure]] which allows random access rather than one that allows only sequential access.
