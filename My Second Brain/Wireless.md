A wireless network is a [[Computer System]] [[Networks|Network]] that uses wireless data connections between network nodes.

## Wireless Benefits
Wireless networking has a lot of appeal in many circumstances and can offer the following capabilities:
- Create temporary connections to existing wired networks
- Establish backup or contingency connectivity for existing wired networks
- Extends a network's span beyond the reach of wire-based or fiber-optic [[Cables]], especially in older buildings where rewiring might be too expensive
- Allows businesses to provide customers with wireless networking easily, offering a service that gets customers in and keeps them there
- Enables users to roam around a corporate or college campus with their machines.

## Types of Wireless Networks 
Depending on the role wireless components play in a network, wireless networks can be subdivided into the follow categories:
- Local Area Networks [[LAN, WAN, MAN|LAN]]: 
- Extended LANs:
- Internet service:
- Mobile computing 

## Wireless [[LAN, WAN, MAN|LAN]] Components
The wireless components of most LANs behave like their wired counterparts, except for the media and related hardware. Where network interface attaches to an antenna and an emitter rather than to a cable.

The heart of a wireless network is the wireless access point (AP):
- Includes an antenna and a transmitter to send and receive wireless traffic but also connect to the wired side of the network
- Shuttles traffic back and forth between a network's wired and wireless sides
- Most small business and home networks use a device typically called a wireless router that combines the functions of an AP, a switch and a router
- Wireless LANs are usually attached to wired networks
