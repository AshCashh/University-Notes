REST is a set of principles that define how Web standards such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and URLs are suppose to be used.

# Key Principles
- Give every thing an ID (URI)
- Link thinks together
	- Global URIs allow almost unbounded linkage of resources and attributes
	- URIs can also capture state, allowing state transitions to be mapped to link transitions 
- Use standard methods
	- Means mainly HTTP: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE
- Resources with multiple representations
- Communicate statelessly
