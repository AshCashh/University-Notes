Network address translation or NAT, translates a private [[Internet Protocol|IP]] address to a public IP address and visa versa. Private addresses are used within local networks and are not routable on the [[Internet, Intranet, Extranet|Internet]]. NAT enables private networks to communicate with the internet via converting private addresses to public addresses.

NAT is used to conserve public IP addresses by allowing one public address to be used by a number of private addresses to access the internet.

Due to NAT performing address translations on both incoming and outgoing packets, it can slow down network performance. NAT also breaks down end-to-end communication and is incompatible with IP security in transport mode.

## The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
IANA is a department that is responsible for the global coordination of the [[Domain Name System|DNS]] Root, IP addressing and other internet protocol resources.
