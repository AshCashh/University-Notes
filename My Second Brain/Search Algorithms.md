A search algorithm is an [[Algorithm]] designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within a particular [[Linear Data Structures|Data Structure]], or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values.

Searching algorithms are 'comparison-based':
- Searching is done either to confirm that a particular item exists in a given collection or to find a data record that is labelled with a given search key.
- The basic operation in searching is usually comparing an item in the collection with the search key
