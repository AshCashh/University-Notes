A service-level agreement is a contract or commitment between a service provider and a customer that defines the services that will be provided to that customer, as well as the service levels that the provider will maintain. Particular aspects of the service include: quality, availability, responsibilities are agreed upon.

An SLA should contain the following:
- Objectives
- Service descriptions
- Provider's and clients duties
- Measurable performance metrics
- Penalties for non-compliance and remedies
# Why are SLAs important?
Contains clear lines of demarcation:
- Expectations of the client and provider are clearly defined
Contract enforcement:
- The agreement can be legally enforceable 
- If a dispute arises, the parties can refer to the contract to help find a solution
# Performance Metrics
Key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be monitored and measured:
## Metric - Network Availability
Network availability is the percentage of time that a network is operational. The gold standard for this is 99.999%.

Network uptime is the percentage of time that a network is operational. 8760 hrs per year means the yearly uptime percentage is equal to the number of hours the network is operational divided by 8760. If the network is down for 10 hours during an entire year then the network uptime is: $\frac{8760-10}{8760}=99.88$ %.

## Metric - Network Performance
**Bandwidth** (network capacity): The maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given time period. Measured in bits per seconds or data packets per second.
**Throughput** (actual data delivery): The actual amount of successful data travelling over a network in a given time period.
**Latency**: The time for a network to transmit data across a certain distance, usually measured in milliseconds.
**Jitter**: The irregular time delay in the sending of data packets across a network.
**Packet Loss**: The failure of data packets to reach the destination.
