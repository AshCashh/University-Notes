Telecommunication is the transmission of information over a distance through some technology. [[Communication System|Telecommunication systems]] are designed to transmit information with as little **deterioration** as possible while satisfying design constrains, such as allowable transmittable energy and signal bandwidth. 

Signal deterioration commonly measures:
- For [[Analogue]] Systems: **Signal-To-Noise Ratio** (SNR) at the receiver output - the ratio of the signal power to the noise power.
- For Digital Systems: **Bit Error Rate** (BER) at the receiver output - the ratio of the number of bits received in error
# Analog and Digital Signals 
A system is either analog or digital based on the possible amplitudes of waveforms it can handle.
- **Analog Information Sources** produce values defined on a continuum:
	- Human voice and other sounds
- **Digital Information Sources** produce a finite set of possible symbols:
	- Computer data
	- MP3 encoder output
