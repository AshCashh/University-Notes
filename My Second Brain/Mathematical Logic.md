Mathematical Logic is the study of formal logic within [[Mathematics]]. Major subareas include model theory, proof theory, set theory and recursion theory. Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power. 

## Uses of Logic
- Basic vocabulary for mathematics and [[Computer Science]]
- Designing and understanding conditional statements in [[Programming]]
- Tool for analysing [[Algorithm|Algorithms]] 
- Mathematical underpinning of bit logic, logical circuits, computer architecture, [[Bitwise Operations]] 
[[Computer System|Computers]] do logic. Everything else is an abstraction on top.
