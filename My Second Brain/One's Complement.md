In [[Computer Science]], the one's complement of a [[Binary]] number is the value obtained by inverting all the bits in the binary representation of the number (i.e, 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 0). The range of values are still the same: $-(2^{n-1} - 1)$ to $2^{n-1}-1$.

However, this representation tackles the second problem in the previous representation as addition is performed via standard binary addition with end-round carry (carry bit is added onto result).
