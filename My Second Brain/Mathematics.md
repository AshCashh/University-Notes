Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes, spaces and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory, algebra, geometry and analysis respectively. 

Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to prove them. These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or in modern mathematics, entities that are stipulated to have certain properties called axioms. 

Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, [[Computer Science]] and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modelling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics such as statistics, and [[Game Theory]], are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics) but often later find practical applications.
