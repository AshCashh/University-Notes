A computer network is a set of [[Computer System|Computers]] sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. Computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. These interconnections are made up on telecommunication network technologies based on physically wired, optical and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

## Encapsulation
At each layer, control information is either added or removed, depending on whether the data is leaving or arriving at a computer. To add additional control information to a data unit as it moves through the layers is called encapsulation. 

Encapsulation process takes place in the sending computer while the de-encapsulation process takes place in the receiving computer. Protocol information can be added before and after the data. If information is added before the data, it is known as header. If information is added after, it is known as trailer.

### Example of Data Encapsulation
Encapsulation is often illustrated with placing a letter into an envelope. On the envelope, we have the sender's and receipt's names and addresses. They are the control information, not the contents of the letter. The sender places the letter into an envelope, which can be illustrated as encapsulation. The recipient removes the envelop, which can be illustrated as de-capsulation.
