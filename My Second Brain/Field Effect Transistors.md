Field-effect [[Transistors]] (FETs) are different from the [[Bipolar Junction Transistors]] that. Broadly speaking, they are similar devices which we might call *charge-control devices*: in both cases (Fig 3.1) we have a three terminal device in which the conduction between two electrodes depends on the availability of charge carriers, which is controlled by a voltage applied to a third *control electrode*.

Here's how they differ: in BFTs the collector-base junction is back-biased, so no current normally flows. Forward-biasing the base-emitter junction by $\approx0.6$V overcomes its diode "contact potential barrier", causing electrons to enter the base region, where they are strongly attracted to the collector. 

In an FET, as the name suggests, conduction in a channel is controlled by an electric field, produced by a voltage applied to the gate electrode. There are no forward biased junctions, so the gate draws no current. This is perhaps the most important advantage of the FET. As with BJTs, there are two polarities, $n$-channel FETs and $p$-channel FETs. These two polarites are analogous to the j
