L'HÃ´pital's rule, also known as Bernoulli's rule is a [[Mathematics|Mathematical]] theorem that allows evaluating limits of indeterminate forms using [[Differential Equations|Derivatives]]. It states that for functions $f$ and $g$ which are differentiable, if:
$$\lim_{x\to c}\cfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\cfrac{0}{0}\space \text{or}\space \cfrac{\pm\infty}{\pm\infty}$$
then,
$$\lim_{x\to c}\cfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to c}\cfrac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$
