A circuit is a [[Mathematics|Mathematical]] model that approximates a system.

There are three basic [[Circuit Elements]]:
- [[Voltage Source]]
- [[Current Source]]
- [[Resistor]]

## Circuit Ground
Zero volts is the circuit ground.
- Any node in a circuit can be defined as zero volts.
- The zero point is referred to as the circuit ground

Choosing zero volts
- Often the point at the bottom of the diagram works 
- Choosing an essential node with many connections will make analysis easier.

## Earth
- An earthed ground is literally a connection to the earth
- If circuit ground is connected to earth

## Bridge Circuits
Resistance can be measured very accurately using a Wheatstone bridge circuit

- Bridge is said to be balanced when no current flows through the ammeter.
- Balanced by adjusting $R_3$
- For a balanced bridge: $R_x = \cfrac{R_2}{R_1}R_3$
- A Wheatstone bridge is balanced by setting the variable resistor to 1563 $\ohm$
