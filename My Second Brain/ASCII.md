ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), is a character [[Encoding]] standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in [[Computer System|Computers]], [[Telecommunications]] equipment and other devices. Because of technical limitations of [[Computer System|Computer Systems]] at the time it was invented in 1963, ASCII has just 128 code points of which only 95 are printable characters, which severally limited its scope. Modern computer systems have evolved to use Unicode, which has millions of code points.
