In a series [[Circuit]], all [[Circuit Elements]] are connected end-to-end to form a single path for [[Current]] flow. If both ends of an element are connected directly to another element, then the connection is considered a [[Parallel Circuits|Parallel Circuit]].

An example of a series circuit can be seen below:

$$ i_a = -i_e $$
$$ i_b = i_a + i_c $$

The total [[Resistance]] in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistors, and the total voltage drop is equal to the sum of the individual voltage sources.
