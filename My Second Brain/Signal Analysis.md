# Signal Representations
A signal can be represented in various forms depending on the method of measurement. There are three main forms of signal representations:
- [[Analogue]]: Continuous in time and continuous in amplitude
- Discrete: Discrete in time and continuous in amplitude
- Digital: Discrete in time and discrete in amplitude

The process of taking discrete time measurements is known as sampling and taking discrete amplitude measurements is known as quantisation.
