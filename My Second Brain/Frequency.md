Frequency ($f$) is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time. Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz) which is equal to one event per second. Ordinary frequency is related to [[Sinusoidal Signals#Angular Frequency ($ omega$)|Angular Frequency]] ($\omega$) by a scaling factor of $2\pi$. The [[Sinusoidal Signals#Period and Frequency|Period]] ($T$) is the interval of time between events, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency.
