In [[Mathematics]], parity is the property of an integer of whether it is even or odd. An integer can have one of two different parities:
**Even**: an even number is an integer of the form:
$$x=2k$$
where $k$ is an integer. An equivalent definition is that an even number is divisible by 2:
$$2\space|\space x\tag{divisible by 2}$$
**Odd**: an odd number is an integer of the form:
$$x=2k+1$$

## Properties
The following laws can be verified using the properties of divisibility. They are a special case of rules in [[Modular Arithmetic]] and are commonly used to check if an equality is likely to be correct by testing the parity of each side.
### Addition and Subtraction
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{even}\pm\text{even}=\text{even}\\
&\text{even}\pm\text{odd}=\text{odd}\\
&\text{odd}\pm\text{odd}=\text{even}
\end{align}
$$
### Multiplication
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{even}\times\text{even}=\text{even}\\
&\text{even}\times\text{odd}=\text{even}\\
&\text{odd}\times\text{odd}=\text{odd}
\end{align}
$$
