In [[Mathematics]] a tuple is a finite sequence or ordered list of numbers, more generally mathematical objects which are called the elements of a tuple. An $n$-tuple is a tuple of $n$ elements. There is only one 0-tuple called the empty tuple. A 1-tuple and a 2-tuple are commonly called a singleton and an ordered pair, respectively.

It's important to note that:
$$(a,b)\neq(b,a)\text{ unless }a=b $$
$$(a,a)\neq (a)$$
In [[Computer Science]], tuples come in many forms. Most typed function [[Programming]] languages implement tuples directly as product types, tightly associated with algebraic data types, pattern matching and destructuring assignment. Many languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as record types, featuring unordered elements accessed by label.
