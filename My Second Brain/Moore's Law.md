Moore's law is the observation that the number of [[Transistors]] in an [[Integrated Circuits|Integrated Circuit]] doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, who in 1965 posited a doubling every year in the number of components per IC and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.

Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development. Advancements in digital [[Electronics]], such as the reduction in quality-adjusted [[Microprocessors & Microcontrollers|Microprocessors]] prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras are strongly linked to Moore's law.
