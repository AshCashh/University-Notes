In [[Mathematics]], a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters. Like a [[Set Theory|Set]], it contains members. The number of elements is called the length of the sequence and unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence.

Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[Functions#Logical Functions|Function]] from natural numbers to the elements at each positions. We define a sequence of length $n$ as a function $x:\{1\dots n\}\to S$ for some set $S$. Typically sequences are notated as $x_j$ rather than $x(j)$ and are typically written as such:
$$x_j=[1,2,5,3,1]$$
