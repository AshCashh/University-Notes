Network architecture is the design of a computer [[Networks|Network]]. It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organisation and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as [[Network Communication|Communication Protocols]] used.

There are two reference models:
- [[Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]] protocol suite
- [[Open System Interconnection]] (OSI) model
Both use layers of hardware and software necessary to transmit data between two points or for multiple devices/applications to interoperate. Divided into separate and achievable function-based layers/modules (each layer/model is easier to manage and maintain).

Note: Layers start at the bottom and work upward.
