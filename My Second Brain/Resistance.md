Resistance (R) is a property of a material to resist the flow of [[Current]], measured in Ohms. [[Ohm's Law]] states that the [[Voltage]] across a component is propertional to the current that flows through it:
$$ v = iR$$
Where,
$$ R = \cfrac{v}{i} = \cfrac{1V}{1A} = 1\ohm $$

Note that not all [[Circuit Elements]] are resistive (or Ohmic), such that they do not follow Ohm's law, this can be seen in [[Diodes]].

## Resistance related to Physical Parameters
Resistance changes depending on the physical properties of the material. 
The following equation expresses the relationship between resistance (R), [[Resistivity]], Length (L) and Area (A).
$$ R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$

Fun fact: Aluminium is used with overhead power lines as its cheaper, while copper is used in housing due to its lower resistivity.

## Measuring resistance
Ohmmeter passes small current through a resistor and measures resulting voltage
