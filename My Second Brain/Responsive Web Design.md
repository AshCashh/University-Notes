Responsive web design (RWD) or responsive design is an approach to [[Web Development|Web Design]] that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and windows or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability and satisfaction.

A responsive design adapts the web-page layout to the viewing environment by using techniques such as fluid proportion based grids, flexible images and [[CSS]] media queries.

## Implementation
Use relative units:
- `%` - relative to parent
- `vw`,`vh` - relative to viewport (width/height)
- `em` - relative to font-size
Use media queries
-  `@media`- apply CSS rules based on:
	- Screen / window size
	- Portrait / landscape
	- Output type: screen, print, screen reader
