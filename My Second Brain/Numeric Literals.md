In [[Computer Science]], a _literal_ is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.

When a fixed value is declared directly in a program, it is referred to as a literal. Prefixes denote various bases.
- [[Binary]] notation requires the prefix 0b
- Decimal notation does not require prefixes
- [[Hexadecimal]] notation requires the prefix 0x
For example: 0x80 (hex) = 0b1000 0000 (binary) = 128 (decimal)
