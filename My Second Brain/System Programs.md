System programs or services provide a convenient environment for program development and execution. They can be divided into these categories:
- **File manipulation**: These programs create, delete, copy, rename, print, list, and generally access and manipulate files and directories.
- **Status information:** Some programs simply ask the system for the date, time, amount of available memory or disk space, number of users, or similar status information.
- **Programming language support:** Compilers, assemblers, debuggers and interpreters.
- **Program loading and execution:** The system may provide absolute loaders,  relocatable loaders, linkage editors, and overlay loaders
- **Communications:** These programs provide the mechanism for creating virtual connections (networks) among processes, users and systems.
	- Allow users to send messages to another's screen, browse web pages, send mail, etc.
- **Background services:** All general-purpose systems have methods for launching certain system-program processes at boot time. Constantly running system-programs processes are known as services, subsystems or daemons.
