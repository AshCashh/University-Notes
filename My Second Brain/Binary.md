In [[Mathematics]] and in [[Computer Science]], a binary digit or bit, is the smallest unit of data. Each bit has a single value of either 1 or 0, which means it can't take on any other value.

A sequence of eight bits is known as a byte, and it is the most common representation of data in digital systems. A sequence of 4 bits is known as a nibble. A sequence of n bits can represent up to $2^n$ states.

### Binary Representation 
The binary system is a base-2 system that uses a sequence of bits to represent a number. Bits are written right-to-left from least significant to most significant bit.
- The **least significant bit** (LSB) is at bit index 0.
- The **most significant bit** (MSB) is at bit index n-1 in an n-bit sequence.

$0000_2 =0$       $0001_2=1$       $0010_2=2$       $0011_2=3$       $0100_2=4$       $0101_2=5$       $0110_2=6$       
$0111_2=7$       $1000_2=8$       $1001_2=9$       $1010_2=10$     $1011_2=11$     $1100_2=12$     $1101_2=13$     $1110_2=14$     $1111_2=15$

Note: the subscript 2 indicates that the number is represented using a base-2 system
