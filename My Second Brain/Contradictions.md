In [[Propositional Logic]], a contradiction occurs when a proposition conflicts either with itself or established fact and hence are always false. A logical contradiction is the conjunction of a statement $S$ and its denial not-$S$. The Aristotle's law of non-contradiction states that "It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect".

Examples in propositional logic consist of:
- $F$
- $\neg T$ 
- $A\wedge\neg A$
- $(A\wedge(A\to B))\to\neg B$
