Network media are the materials through which [[Networks|Network]] signals travel between devices. Typical examples include copper [[Cables]] or glass fiber or simply the air. When physical material is used as the [[Network Communication#Hardward Component|Medium]], it refers to wired networking and when signals are transmitted through the air, the medium is called [[Wireless]].

## Criteria for Choosing Network Media
All cables share certain fundamental characteristics such as bandwidth, distance, interference, ease of installation, cost, and security.

### Bandwidth 
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be carried from one point to another for a given time period (usually a second).
- Expressed in bits per second (bps)
- Speeds can be measured in the millions of bits per second (megabits per second Mbps) or billions of bits per second (gigabits per second / Gbps)
- Not related with MB/s (Megabytes per second or GB/s, Gigabytes per second)

### Maximum Segment Length 
A cable segment is a length of cable between two network devices, such as [[Network Communication#Hardward Component|NICs]] or [[Network Communication#Hardward Component|Switches]]. Any intermediate passive (unpowered) devices, such as wall jacks are considered part of the total segment length. 

Each cable type can transport data at a particular speed only so far before its signal begins to weaken past (called attenuation).

### Electronical Interference
Interference to electrical signals on copper media comes in the form of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Motors, transformers, fluorescent lights and other sources of intense electrical activity can emit both EMI and RFI. Devices that share the same channel can cause noise and weaken the signals.

### Environmental Interference
RFI problems are also associated with the proximity of strong broadcast sources in an environment (radio or TV station). Other environmental factors include computers, refrigerators, fans, lighting fixtures. 

Weather conditions may affect wireless signal integrity, e.g. lighting, fog.

### Eavesdropping Susceptibility
Because electrical signals traveling down a copper wire create an electromagnetic field that can be detected outside the wires, copper wire is susceptible to electronic eavesdropping. 

However, fiber-optic media carries light signals and is not susceptible to interference or eavesdropping.

## [[Wireless]] vs. Wired Networking
Speed:
- Wired [[Ethernet]] is faster than wireless than Wi-Fi, although Wi-Fi it is becoming faster in recent years
Stability:
- Wireless is susceptible to environmental factors
	- Radio waves can be blocked by walls and floors
	- Can interfere with microwaves, cordless phones
Mobility, installation and convenience:
- E.g. connecting to speakers, Wi-Fi appliances
Security:
- Wireless transmission can be intercepted easier than wired transmission
