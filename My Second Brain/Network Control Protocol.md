The Network Control Protocol (NPC) was a communication protocol for a [[Computer System|Computer]] [[Networks|Network]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. It provided the the first standard operational packet-switching protocol on [[ARPANET]] and standardised the [[ARPANET]] network interface, the predecessor to the modern Internet.

NPC allowed users to access and use computers and devices at remote locations and to transmit files between computers. NPC provided the middle layer of the protocol stack and enabled application services such as email and file transfer. Robert Kahn and Vinton Cert built on NPC to develop the standard [[Transmission Control Protocol & Internet Protocol Suite|TCP/IP]]
