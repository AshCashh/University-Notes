$I^2$C or Inter-Integrated circuit is a common [[Serial Communication]] often used on [[Microprocessors & Microcontrollers|Microcontrollers]]. It is suitable for short distances (typically < 300mm) and wildely used for external periphals, buad range is typically up to 400kbaud. It supports Half-duplex, synchronous, 2-wire bus, with bidirectional signalling, where devices use [[Open-Drain Outputs]]
