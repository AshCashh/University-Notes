The electron is a subatomic particle with a negative one elementary electric [[Charge]]. Electrons belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure. 

Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as [[Electricity]], magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity; they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field; if that electron is moving relative to an observer, the observer will observe it to generate a magnetic field.
