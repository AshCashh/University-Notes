Abstraction is the act of ignoring irrelevant detail. It allows us to capture the relevant properties of any given situation.
#### Example
Imagine someone is called in to check whether a sheep can go through all the doorways in a certain house. It is allowed to take measurements of the sheep but not physically push the sheep through the doors. Furthermore, justification of the conclusion is also required. One solution is to model the complex shape of the sheep mathematically using millions of points, and then build a computer program which rotates the sheep in different ways so as to assess whether it actually passes through all the doorways. A smarter solution, however, would be to physically check that the sheep fits inside a two metre by one metre by one metre box. Then, using pencil and paper, it can easily be shown that, since all the doorways are at least one metre wide and one metre high, the sheep can go through them all. What is so strong about this approach is that these mathematicians started by reasoning, ‘if we know that the sheep will fit in such a box, then we can prove that it passes through all the doorways.’ The act of using a box rather than the actual sheep gives a much simpler object to reason about, and is called abstraction.



#### Example 2

Suppose the following problem:
- You have some apples
- You have some friends 
- You want to know if you have enough apples to give on to each friend

We first start by extracting all important information needed from the problem and assign each piece to an arbitrary value:
- $x$ is number of apples in each basket $A$ before moving them
- $y$ is number of apples in each basket $B$ before moving them
- $z$ is number of apples in the final basket after moving
We can now write an equation solving for $z$.
$$z = x+ y$$
