Electronics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the principles of physics to design, create and operate devices that manipulate [[Electron|Electrons]] and other charged particles. Electronics is a subfield of [[Electrical Engineering]], but it differs from it in that it focuses on using active devices such as [[Transistors]], [[Diodes]] and [[Integrated Circuits]] to control and amplify the flow of electric [[Current]] and to convert it from one form to another, such as from AC to DC or from [[Analogue]] to digital. Electronics also encompasses the fields of microelectronics, nano electronics, optoelectronics and quantum electronics, which deal with the fabrication and application of electronic devices at microscopic, nanoscopic, optical and quantum scales.

Electronics have a profound impact on various aspects of modern society and culture, such as communication, entertainment, education, health care, industry and security. The main driving force behind the advancement of electronics is the semiconductor industry, which produces the basic materials and components for electronic devices and [[Circuit|Circuits]].
