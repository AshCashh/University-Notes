In [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]], signed integers are used to represent all integers that can be positive or negative. The following representations allow us to encode negative integers using a sequence of [[Binary]] bits:
- [[Sign-Magnitude]]
- [[One's Complement]]
- [[Two's Complement]] (most common)
