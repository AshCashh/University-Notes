Charge (q) represents the quantity of [[Electricity]]. More charge is more electricity. Charge is measured in [[Coulombs]] (C). The charge of an [[Electron]] is $1.602*10^{-19}C$

Think about the quantity of charge as the amount of water in a bucket.![](app://local/Users/ashasaunders/Downloads/ash's%20vault/PNGs/Pasted%20image%2020230222171354.png?1677050034738)
