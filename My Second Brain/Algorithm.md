An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. In the context of [[Computer Science]] and [[Programming]], an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, unambiguous instructions or operations that when executed accomplish a particular [[Computation]] task.
## Characteristics 
Some key characteristics of algorithms include:
**Input:** Algorithms take input from a defined set of values or variables
**Output:** They produce output, providing a result or solution to the given problem
**Definiteness:** Each step in an algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously defined
**Finiteness:** Algorithms must have a finite number of steps, meaning they must eventually stop
**Effectiveness:** Algorithms are designed to be effective, meaning they solve the problem for all possible inputs.

# Efficiency & Analysis
Algorithm efficiency is usually represented as a [[Mathematics|Mathematical]] function describing the resource requirements of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data the algorithm must process.

There are two main efficiency measures for the efficiency of algorithms:
1. **Time Efficiency**: A mathematical function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm
2. Space efficiency: A mathematical function describing the amount of space (storage) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm
