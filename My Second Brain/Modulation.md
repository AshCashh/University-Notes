The process of modulation produces a signal that is suitable for transmission through the channel by transforming the message signal $m(t)$ to a new signal $s(t)$. Modulation is often performed with respect to another signal, called the **carrier** signal $c(t)$. Here the message *modulates* the carrier to produce the transmitted signal $s(t)$.
