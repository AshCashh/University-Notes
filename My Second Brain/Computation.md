A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined. Common examples of computations are [[Mathematics|Mathematical Equations]] and computer [[Algorithm|Algorithms]].

Mechanical or electronic devices (or, historically, people) that perform computations are known as computers. The study of computation is the field of computability, itself a sub-field of [[Computer Science]].

In the theory of computation, a diversity of mathematical models of computation have been developed. Typical mathematical models of computers are the following:
- State models including [[Turing Machine]], pushdown automation, [[State Machines]] and PRAM.
- Functional models including lambda calculus 
- Logical models including logic [[Programming]]
