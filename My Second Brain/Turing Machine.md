A Turing machine is a [[Mathematics|Mathematical]] model of [[Computation]] describing an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the models simplicity, it is capable of implementing any computer [[Algorithm]]. 

The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, who called it an automatic machine. It was Turing's Doctoral advisor, Alonzo Church, who later coined the term "Turning machine" in a review. Today, they are considered to be one of the foundational models of computability and theoretical [[Computer Science]].
