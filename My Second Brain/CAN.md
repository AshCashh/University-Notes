CAN or Controller Area Network is a [[Serial Communication]]. Its a very prevalent automotice and industrial standard, suitable for medium distances (40m to 500m). It's robust and reliable (safety critical systems). Has built-in message priority and arbitration and typically ranges up to 1 Mbaud. It supports Half-duplex, asynchronous, 2-wire bus (one differntial pair). Has very precise timing requirements compared with [[UART]] and has complex protocol and controller
