Software is a set of computer programs and associated documentation and data. At the lowest [[Programming]] level, executable code consists of machine language (like [[Assembly Programming |Assembly]]) [[Instructions]] supported by an individual processor - typically a CPU or GPU. Machine language consists of groups of [[Binary]] values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state.

The majority of software is written in high-level [[Programming]] languages. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to natural language than machine languages. High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler, an interpreter, or a combination of the two.
