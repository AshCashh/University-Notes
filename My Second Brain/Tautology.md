In [[Mathematical Logic]], a tautology is a formula or assertion that is true in every possible interpretation. Mathematical examples include $x=y$ or $x\neq y$. Similarly, "either the ball is green or the ball is not green" is always true, regardless of the colour of the ball.

Tautologies are a key concept in [[Propositional Logic]], where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible boolean valuation of its propositional variables. A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an effective method exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied.

Examples include:
- $T$
- $\neg F$
- $A\vee\neg A$
- $\neg(A\wedge\neg A)$
- $(A\wedge(A\to B))\to B$
