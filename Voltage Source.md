A voltage source is a [[Circuit Elements|Circuit Element]] that produces or dissipates [[Power]] at a specified [[Voltage]] with whatever [[Current]] is required.
- Indicated by a circle with the plus. 
- Plus sign indicates which side is positive

## Voltage Sources in Series Circuits
According to [[Kirchhoff's Laws]]. The sum of all voltages around a loop equals zero, this law is applicable when multiple voltage sources are within a [[Series Circuits]].

KVL gives:
$$ v_1 + v_2 + v_3 - iR = 0 $$
$$ (v_1 + v_2 + v_3) = iR $$
Equivalent voltage:
$$ v_{eq} = iR $$
$$ v_{eq} = v_1 + v_2 + v_3 $$
Therefore, **voltage sources in series are summed.**
