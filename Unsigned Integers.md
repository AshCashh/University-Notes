In [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]], unsigned integers (often called "uints") represent the set of counting (natural) numbers, starting at 0. In the decimal system (base-10), the unsigned integers are encoded using a sequence of decimal digits (0-9). 

The decimal system is a positional numeral system, where the contribution of each digit is determined by its position. For example:
$$278_{10} = 2\times10^2 + 7\times10^1 + 8\times10^0$$
$$ = 2\times100 + 7\times10 + 8\times1$$
$$ = 200 + 70 + 8 $$
In the [[Binary]] system (base-2) the unsigned integers are encoded using a sequence of binary digits (0-1) in the same manner. For example:
$$ 10101_2 = 1\times 2^4 + 0\times 2^3 + 1\times 2^2 + 0\times 2^1 + 1\times 2^0$$
$$ = 1\times16+0\times8+1\times4+0\times2+1\times1$$
$$=16+4+1$$
$$=21_{10}$$
The range of values an n-bit binary number can hold when encoding an unsigned integer is 0 to $2^n-1$.
