The Interface Message Processor (IMP) was the packet switching node used to interconnect participant [[Networks]] to the [[ARPANET]] from the late 1960s to 1989. It was the first generation of gateways, known today as routers. An IMP was a ruggedised Honeywell DDP-516 minicomputer with special-purpose interfaces and software. An IMP requires the connection to a host [[Computer System|Computer]] via a special bit-serial interface. The IMP software and the ARPA network communications protocol running on the IMPs was discussed in RFC1, the first of a series of standardisation documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
