Computer Science is the scientific and practical approach to computer-based system design, development and operation, simply put it is the study of computers and their operations. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as [[Algorithm|Algorithms]], [[Computation]] and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of [[Hardware]] and [[Software]]) and is often closely associated to computer [[Programming]]. 

Areas such as [[Operating Systems]], [[Networks]] and [[Embedded Systems]] investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components (like [[Transistors]], or [[Hardware Peripherals]]) and computer-operated equipment. [[Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Machine Learning]] aim to synthesise goal-oriented processes such as problem-solving, decision making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans.

Computer science is considered by some to have a much closer relationship with [[Mathematics]] than many scientific disciplines, some defining computing is a mathematical science. Early computer science was strongly influenced by the work of mathematicians such as Alan Turing, Kurt GÃ¶del, John von Neumann and many others.
